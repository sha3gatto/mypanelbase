Easiest and Powerful way to add header, hero image & content to your Genesis powered sites. Powered by native widget, you can add almost anything!

== Description ==

<h3>Easy & Powerful just like Genesis Framework</h3>

<p><strong>Easy</strong><br />Add hero image and any content via widgets! Drag and Drop your desired contents, choose the background hero image and your done! Easy as pie!</p>
<p><strong>Powerful</strong><br />Add anything via widget! From welcome text to subscription form as long as there's a widget you can have it! Integrated gracefully with the framework you can customize the view as full window height and behind the header section. Wait for it.... hooks & filters for geeky fellows to control and modify the views, very well documented just like Genesis ;)</p>

<p>I can't define the plugin's awesomeness, describe it your self then. Take a look at the demo and spread the love by sharing. Thank you!</p>
